### About
Programming is something I've always loved and it has always been a hobby of mine rather than a profession or a future profession. Just being able to open up an file, write something, and see what I wrote work brings me a joy that I have just loved for years.


Mainly, I use python, including using Ren'Py and PyGame. I also work with HTML and CSS, and love playing with Markdown. 
Some things I wish to learn and experiment with are React and Godot.
