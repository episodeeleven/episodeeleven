### About
Programming is something I've always loved and it has always been a hobby of mine rather than a profession or a future profession. Just being able to open up an file, write something, and see what I wrote work brings me a joy that I have just loved for years.


Mainly, I use ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-%233776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=%23ffffff)
, including using ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ren'Py-%23FF7F7F?style=for-the-badge&logo=ren'py&logoColor=%23ffffff)
 and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyGame-%233776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=%23ffffff)
. I also work with ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-%23E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=%23ffffff)
 and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-%23663399?style=for-the-badge&logo=css&logoColor=%23ffffff), and love playing with ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-%23000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=markdown&logoColor=%23ffffff). 
Some things I wish to learn and experiment with are ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-%2361DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%23ffffff) and ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-%23478CBF?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot%20engine&logoColor=%23ffffff).

What I plan on doing here is just releasing random projects that something will hopefully find something out of. Possible things that could be considered games will be published to an Itch profile whatsoever.

### Contact Me
As of now, there are zero plans on having a way to contact me. Like said previously, programming/scripting is purely a passion of mine and I do not plan on working for it or getting monetized for it simply because it is something I enjoy. Feel free to interact with me here on on Itch, but don't expect me accepting any offers or requests of any kind. I'm just here to experiment.
